An intentionally very fast (S)ARIMA(X) implementation. Any major difference as compared to the **R** `arima()` function may be considered a bug.


# Thanks, recognition

This package really follows the 'I stand on the shoulders of giants' idea. It would have never been possible without all the careful work put into R's `arima()` implementation done by many member of the R Core Team and others over the years. I do believe professor Ripley is of particular note here, and deserves recognition for being one of the driving forces behind such an awesome project. 

I further want to thank the authors of the awesome **Eigen** C++ template library. This library is one of the silent drivers of much of this computation, particularly the handling of external variables. 

Finally, last but not least, I believe the many people who contributed to the great **CppNumericalSolvers** library deserve recognition. This is the library used for optimization in this package, and it's relatively straightforward implementation has been a huge boon.
